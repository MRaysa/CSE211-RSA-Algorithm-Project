## üìñ About the RSA Algorithm

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. This project highlights:
- The mathematical foundations of RSA, including prime number factorization and modular arithmetic.
- Implementation challenges, optimizations, and potential enhancements.
- Real-world applications such as digital signatures, VPN key exchanges, and SSL certificates.
